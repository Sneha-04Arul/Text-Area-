## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user types text inside a `<textarea>`.
2. A JavaScript event listener detects each keystroke (`input` event).
3. The script counts the number of characters typed.
4. The counter updates in real-time, displaying:
   - **Number of characters typed**
   - **Remaining characters allowed**
5. If the user exceeds the limit:
   - Extra characters are automatically removed.
   - A red warning message appears.
